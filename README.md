# Introduction

Inference-ConstV-EM is a framework that infers chemical kinetics and thermodynamic properties from constant-volume combustion tests of energetic materials. 
The framework utilizes the sensitivity analysis for a dynamical system (expressed by ODEs) that describes the physical behaviors of constant-volume combustion, and extract the chemical kinetics and thermodynamic properties in the constrained space by ODEs. 
The details can be found in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2023.143779).
